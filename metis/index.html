          <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Hudson's Bay Company establishes trade in Rupert's Land. Many traders would marry Indigenous women in order
            to establish a connection and improve the relationship between the traders and the Native peoples. Their children
            would grow up in Rupert's land, living next to one another, beginning to develop the Anglophone Metis/Country-born
            identity.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc">The French fur traders who traded in the Great Lakes area also married Indigenous women for the same reasons. Communities
            founded by gens libres (the men who were no longer contracted by a trading company) started to appear, and some
            of them settled in the Red River region, where the ethnogenesis of the francophone Metis occurred.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc"> The Red River Colony is established and settled by the Earl of Selkirk by an agreement with the HBC. The settlers
            antagonized the Metis people and the North West Company, cutting off pemmican trade, prohibiting buffalo hunting
            and attacking rival trade forts.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc"> The Battle of Seven Oaks, which was the climax of an armed conflict between the NWC and the HBC known as the Pemmican
            War. A band of Metis led by Cuthbert Grant seized a supply of pemmican previously stolen from them from the HBC
            with the intention of selling it to the NWC. At the site known as the Seven Oaks, they encountered a group of
            NBC employees and Selkirk settlers. A gunfight ensued, where the Metis won, outnumbering the HBC people almost
            3 to 1.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc">The trial of Pierre-Guillaume Sayer and 3 other Metis traders who had violated the HBC's trading ban. Although
            he was found guilty, the judge levied no punishment, fearing an armed conflict. This event put the end to the
            HBC's trading monopoly, effectively allowing free trade in the Assiniboia district.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Battle of Grand Coteau was fought between the Metis and the Sioux of North Dakota, motivated by the competition
            between two groups for buffalo. The Metis successfully defended their position, and the victory has become a
            part of Metis folklore.

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1869</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc"> Rupert's Land is sold to Canada by the HBC. Metis leaders protested against the notion of their land being transferred
            without their consent. This triggered an uprising by the Metis to protect their land rights and culture, known
            as the Red River rebellion. The Metis National Committee and a provisional government are established. Louis
            Riel becomes the leader of the Metis resistance. The final version of the Metis Bill of Rights is drawn up, intended
            to be the list of conditions for the entry of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada as a new province.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc">Metis dispersal from the Red River. The settlers of the newfound province were often hostile to the Metis. As a
            result, more than two thirds left the area in the following years after the Manitoba Act.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc"> The North-West Rebellion, a five-month insurgency against the government, is fought by Metis and their Aboriginal
            allies under Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont. The rebels were defeated by federal troops, and Riel was executed.
            This event lead to the second Metis dispersal, after which the Metis ceased to be a group of any social or political
            influence until their re-emergence in the 20th century.
