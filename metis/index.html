        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Hudson's Bay Company establishes trade in Rupert's Land. Many traders would marry Indigenous women in order to establish
        a connection and improve the relationship between the traders and the Native peoples. Their children would grow up in Rupert's
        land, living next to one another, beginning to develop the Anglophone Metis/Country-born identity.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The French fur traders who traded in the Great Lakes area also married Indigenous women for the same reasons. Communities
        founded by gens libres (the men who were no longer contracted by a trading company) started to appear, and some of them settled
        in the Red River region, where the ethnogenesis of the francophone Metis occurred.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc"> The Red River Colony is established and settled by the Earl of Selkirk by an agreement with the HBC. The settlers antagonized
        the Metis people and the North West Company, cutting off pemmican trade, prohibiting buffalo hunting and attacking rival
        trade forts.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc"> The Battle of Seven Oaks, which was the climax of an armed conflict between the NWC and the HBC known as the Pemmican War.
        A band of Metis led by Cuthbert Grant seized a supply of pemmican previously stolen from them from the HBC with the intention
        of selling it to the NWC. At the site known as the Seven Oaks, they encountered a group of NBC employees and Selkirk settlers.
        A gunfight ensued, where the Metis won, outnumbering the HBC people almost 3 to 1.</p>
